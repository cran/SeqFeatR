\details{
  Takes the results from assocpoint and assocpair/assocpairfeat and
  tries to combine them into one result: we are looking for pairs of
  sequence alignment positions where (a) each of the positions is significantly associated
  with the feature (for significance level see parameter
  significance_level), and (b) the sequence states of both positions are
  associated. Pairs of positions fulfilling these two criteria may e.g.
  carry compensatory mutations.
  If at least one such mutation is found, a detailed output is additionally
  created with possible compensatory mutations}

\value{A csv file with p-value for alignment position pairs and if existing
       a csv file with possible compensatory mutations.}
