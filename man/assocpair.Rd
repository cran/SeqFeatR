\title{Finding pairs of alignment positions that jointly mutate}

\description{Determines pairs of sequence alignment positions that
  mutate in a correlated fashion with respect to a consensus sequence.}
  
\usage{assocpair(path_to_file_sequence_alignment = NULL,
    path_to_file_consensus = NULL, save_name_csv, dna = FALSE,
    significance_level = 0.05, multiple_testing_correction = "bonferroni")}
    
\arguments{
  \item{path_to_file_sequence_alignment}{FASTA file with sequence alignment. See example file.}
  \item{path_to_file_consensus}{FASTA file with consensus sequence. See example file.}
  \item{save_name_csv}{name of file to which results are written in csv format.}
  \item{dna}{indicates whether sequences are DNA or amino acids.}
  \item{significance_level}{significance level for Fisher's exact test.}
  \item{multiple_testing_correction}{multiple testing correction applied to p-values. Input can be: "holm",\cr
 "hochberg", "hommel", "bonferroni", "BH", "BY", "fdr", "none".}
}
\details{For every position in the sequence alignment from the FASTA
  file a Fisher's exact test is applied with every other position in the
  sequence to check whether at both positions we have correlated
  mutations with respect to a given consensus sequence. Significant p-values are
  collected in one big table. p.adjust from stats package is used for multiple testing
  correction; corrected values are given as extra column in csv output.
  
  In contrast to assocpairfeat, assocpair does not use features, but uses a consensus
  approach.
  }
  
\value{A csv file with every possible co-mutation below the given p-value.}
